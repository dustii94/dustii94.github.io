    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a young and still-growing developer looking to utilize the skills I have learned from the Milwaukee School of Engineering and my previous summer internships in a real-world environment. While I enjoy working on front-end, I’m also engaged in back-end development.</p>
    <p>I love seeing the results of my work on the computer screen as I hack away at the keyboard. While I might not show it much on the outside, I really enjoy being good company to others, whether it is helping someone with a problem or simply hanging out and playing games with another after hours.</p>
